# WWDC Project 2023

I submitted this project as Swift Student Challenge for WWDC'23.

# Main Objective 
The main objective of this application is to help parents learn ASL for their children who are born deaf or not able to speak.
You can also convert your actions to ASL Letters Actions to English Alphabets. 

Feel free to explore the project and give feedback. 

## How to run? 

1. You need to install Swift Playgrounds for iPad/MacOS. 
2. You need to give camera permission.
